The current build is setup for IntelliJ integration.  Eclipse integration can be added by using the Eclipse plugin.

## Notes

Currently in IntelliJ there is a defect around AutoValue generation with Gradle placing two versions of a generated
class, for classes generated by the apt plugin, onto the classpath.  The easiest way to work around this is to simply
delete the generated folder (this will allow you to utilize the built versions in the service package).

More familiarity with Gradle could probably help overcome this issue.
